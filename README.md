 **future plan** :


## Future Development Roadmap
- Fine-tune a medical NER model (e.g., BioClinicalBERT) on pharmacy scripts.
- Add support for handwritten OCR via Google Vision or Azure OCR.
- Deploy the model as an API using FastAPI.
- Add a simple Streamlit front-end for uploading prescriptions online.
